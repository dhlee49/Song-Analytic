And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show

Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near

I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldn't let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didn't know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me

Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me

"Ace Of Base,Cecilia,/a/ace+of+base/cecilia_20003562.html,"This is a song about a well-known girl  
Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got  
If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
I wonder

Of a lonely man  
So clearly now reaching out for me  
Lead me to the light  
  
And sail the endless sea  
So lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
The edge of heaven is near  
  
We'll sail the endless sea
